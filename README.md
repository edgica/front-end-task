## It is test task of Ievgeniia Miroshko.

To create a simple grid `https://github.com/janl/mustache.js` was used.

`mustache.js` is an implementation of the mustache template system in JavaScript.

Mustache is a logic-less template syntax. It can be used for HTML, config files, source code - anything. It works by expanding tags in a template using values provided in a hash or object.

To start your search for repositories that have been written in JavaScript, used `map` search keyword and sorted by stars in descending order, please click on button "Search for map tag". As a result you will see grid of first 100 github repositories matching the search parameters.

And good luck!
